SELECT 
  TOP (20) description,
  nerc_region,
  event_date
FROM 
  grid 
  -- Order by nerc_region, affected_customers & event_date
  -- Event_date should be in descending order
ORDER BY
  nerc_region,
  affected_customers,
  event_date DESC;

-- Select nerc_region and demand_loss_mw
SELECT 
  nerc_region, 
  demand_loss_mw 
FROM

-- Retrieve rows where affected_customers is >= 500000  (500,000)
WHERE 
  affected_customers >= 500000;
```

```{sql connection=}

SELECT 
  description, 
  affected_customers,
